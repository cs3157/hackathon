          <p>The teaching staff of 3157 would like to thank all of you who came out to the
          hackathon. We all had a great time helping, teaching, and learning and hope you
          did too. The event was incredibly well attended and we were excited to see so many
          of you stick around to the very end. Happy hacking! </p>

          <p>The 3157 Hackathon was an optional hackathon intended for students 
          and alumni of the <a href="http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jae/3157">w3157</a> class.
          Throughout the night of October 25th, from 9pm-5am, in Carlton Lounge in Mudd, at Columbia
          students worked on two
          big assignments from the class. Alumni and TAs were on hand to help students
          with these assignments.</p>

          <p>This hackathon isn't just a homework programming session, it's also an open 
          learning environment. Whether you're a hackathon veteran or this is your first 
          time, stop by. Representatives from <strong>Women in Computer Science (WICS)</strong>
          will be on hand to talk about their individual experiences in the field. If you're a Barnard
          student who would like to learn more about what its like to be a programmer, 
          or what a hackathon is like, do come by as well.</p>

          <p>Aside from all the awesome people, we'll also have <strong>pizza and drinks</strong>
          to keep you fueled all night, <strong>tasty treats</strong> from GitHub, 
          <strong>3157 swag</strong>, and <strong>swag from our sponsors!</strong></p>

          <h3>What do we do there?</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>Current students:</strong>
            work on <code>lab4</code> or <code>lab5</code>, 
            or help your classmates
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Former students:</strong>
            help out current students on <code>lab4</code> and
            <code>lab5</code> (while also hacking
            on your own projects!)
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Everyone:</strong>
            hang out, eat pizza, talk, listen, laugh, sleep

          <h3>To be totally clear...</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Attendance is <strong>not</strong> required. It&apos;s
            completely optional. It&apos;s totally understandable if you
            have better things to do Friday night than geeking out all
            night</li>
            <li>If you come, you don&apos;t have to stay all night. You
            can come and go as you please</li>
            <li>At that time, both <code>lab4</code> and
            <code>lab5</code> will be open for submission. You can work
            on either.</li>
            <li>During the hackathon, we will have a very loose
            collaboration policy. You can look at your classmates&apos;
            code to learn or to help. You can sit down with someone else
            and try things together. All I ask is for you to make a
            genuine effort to learn or to help. You can list the poeple
            you have collaborated with in your README to make sure that
            your code does not trigger cheating detection.
            <ul>
              <li>Additionally, if you wish to set up a Github
              repo for yourself and your partner, the repo must
              be private. GitHub offers
              <strong><a href="http://www.github.com/edu">free</a> private
                repository to students, but it takes a few days</strong> to
              process, so make sure to sign up before the
              hackathon.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The hackathon would also be a great opportunity for you
            to learn from your savvy TAs and classmates about some of
            the extra stuff that will enrich your shell
            experience&mdash;nifty <code>.bashrc</code> setups,
            <code>vim</code>/<code>emacs</code> setup, VirtualBox
            setups, using <code>GDB</code>, etc.</li>
            <li>For <code>lab4</code> you may optionally work in pairs,
            with an appropriately more complex set of tasks for pairs
            compared to individuals. The hackathon is a great place to
            work with your partner! More details in the <code>lab4</code>
            directions.</li>
